      "\\Moderator:  Thank you very much, sir. We take the first question from the line of Mr. Balasubramanian from \n",
      "Arihant Capital.  Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Balasubramanian : My first question, like we are launching around 7 to 8 5G products from Q2 FY '24 to Q1 FY \n",
      "'25. What would be the telecom revenue share as expected to reach in FY '25? And in the last 2 \n",
      "quarters, Telecom Products margins are around 19%. We may expect about 20% kind of margins \n",
      "to do these new launches. These are my first questions.  \n",
      "Mahendra Nahata : As I said, the telecom and networking  products revenue is targeted  to reach INR800 crores to \n",
      "INR1,000 crores in FY '25. And this significant growth is going to come from new products \n",
      "which we are launching.  As I've said in my opening remarks, a number of n ew products are \n",
      "going to be launched in the current financial year and they are in advanced stage of development. \n",
      "So once these products are launched, they are definitely going to increase revenue multiple times \n",
      "and it is targeted at INR800 crores to INR1,000 crores in FY '25.  \n",
      "And number two, as far as margin  is concerned , the products are our own designed and \n",
      "manufactured. It's will certainly have much better margins  than 19%.  \n",
      "Balasubramanian:  Okay. Got it, sir. Sir, in Q4 FY '23, turnkey contracts witnessed margins less than 5%. Any \n",
      "specific reasons for that?  \n",
      "Mahendra Nahata : Many times  Margins on EPC contracts varies quarter -on-quarter, depending on the type and part \n",
      "of contract executed in a particular quarter.  So, what happen ed in this particular  quarter, the EPC \n",
      "contracts which have been executed, the part of that was at a lower margin. So, you see lower \n",
      "margin in this particular quarter. It is a bit of an aberration also, but it has happened like that.  \n",
      "However, overall EBITDA margins in turnkey project ranges between 8% to 12%. Now with \n",
      "increasing share of revenue from product business, EBITDA margin on over-all basis are also \n",
      "increasing year -on-year and currently ranging between 14% to 15%. The margins are now \n",
      "planned  to increase further through  high level backward integration and introduction and launch \n",
      "of indigenously developed products on an overall basis. But turnkey margins this particular \n",
      "quarter it was low because of execution and sale of particular  part of contract. However, the \n",
      "overall m argins are intact and it will increase in future.  \n",
      "Balasubramanian:  Okay got it sir. Sir on the railway side recently we got the Surat metro rail projects Phase 1. Like \n",
      "any further tender or projects are lined up like how we are compatible to execut e on rai lway \n",
      "projects. Because nowadays railway projects are more competitive and margins are slightly \n",
      "lower. What is your thought process on that sir?  \n",
      "Mahendra Nahata:  You know we have got a very prominent  position in railway communication business in the \n",
      "Country . In a sense that not only we have executed contracts in India,  but we have executed \n",
      "contracts in other Countries  also like Mauritius, Bangladesh. So, we will continue to be in this\n",

      "s area and we should  do both good revenue and profitability.  \n",
      "As far as Surat metro contracts , this will be  executed as has been planned. And we have b id into \n",
      "many other contracts also , different metro you know where metro extensi ons are coming up or \n",
      "new metro lines are coming up. We have bid into the contracts and we are confident that we \n",

      "orders and they are already getting executed by us. And  similarly,  we are working on various \n",
      "other metro contracts where we expect reasonably good order position.  \n",
      "Balasubramanian:  Sir on the margin side on railway projects like how the margins are? \n",
      "Mahendra Nahata:  It is something like turnkey  contracts only. Only problem in the railway projects is that revenue  \n",
      "come s late as you know in a sense that telecom is the last thing to be done. And the contracts are \n",
      "awarded  when the metro is planned , then you know civil work is done, electrical work is done \n",
      "and all k ind of things are done. Then you know this telecom business comes up. So, you know \n",
      "it is not that you got the order and it will be getting executed in one year. It will take 3, 4, 5 years \n",
      "to get it executed because the civil work and all that in the metro takes time. So, margins are like \n",

      "Page 13 of 20 \n",

      "for EPC contracts come in bulk. So, orders woul d not reflect the correct position. But in terms \n",
      "of order book right now , I would say, about 90% orders are of EPC contracts, 10% would go \n",
      "into product contracts.  \n",

      "Mahendra Nahata:  Yes, this will increase. This will definitely increase because of increased number of products \n",
      "which are being inducted. And also at the same time, incr ease in capacity. But let me tell you \n",
      "one more thing. In terms of revenue, as you see, the position is reversed. Product based revenue \n",
      "is 56%. So that is the difference I want to talk about. That, orders does not represent real revenue. \n",
      "The orders of EPC c ontracts have bulk orders coming at one point of time. Product orders are \n",

      "Sahil Sanghvi:  Right sir. And what would be the export domestic mix over here?  \n",

      "Last year it was 7% and 93%. It is now 17% and 83%. But we are targeting to reach to 25% in \n",

      "but what range can we expect for these telecom products?  \n",
      "Mahendra Nahata:  You know, it differs from product -to-product, you're right. Because  some products which are \n",
      "highly competitive and number of manufacturers are more, but demand is high, so the margin is \n",

      "channels, there was a flash that there might be an anti -dumping duty and the companies have \n",

      "Mahendra Nahata:  We are neutral to this. We have  not applied. We are neutral to this because our own fiber  optic \n",

      "yet to be accepted and finalized, but yes, it has been recommended by the Commerce Ministry. \n",

      "dumping duty on the fiber  which is used for export of cable. If I manufacture some cable for \n",
      "exports, there is no anti -dumping duty there. So, when we are importing fiber , a lot of it is for \n",
      "exports only.  \n",
      "So, we would not be impact ed by that either. Domestic market, we produce enough fiber  to \n",
      "address our domestic customers. So, we would be rather protected than being harmed in any \n",
      "way. And with our increasing capacity, we have a further protection . But the problem would be \n",
      "to smalle r players. Smaller players who are not producing their own fiber , they would have a lot \n",

      "assure you, on overall basis the margins are going to be totally intact and in future they are going \n",

      "Hardik Vyas:  Okay, so the other question is sir, what is the idea on OFC pricing, have the prices again gone \n",
      "up because of the demand increasing in the US and world over or the pricing remains more or \n",
